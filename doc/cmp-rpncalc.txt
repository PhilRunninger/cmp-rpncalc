Reverse Polish Notation, RPN for short, is a mathematical notation in which
operators follow their operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN), in which
operators precede their operands. The description "Polish" refers to the
nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented Polish notation in 1924.

*Overview*                                                          *rpn-overview*

This plugin is a processor that takes an RPN expression as input and inserts
the results in the current buffer. It operates in two different ways.

1. As a completion source for the nvim-cmp plugin, which can be found here:
https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp. While an RPN expression is entered,
nvim-cmp will present two options for selection. For example, when typing:
`1 2 3 ** +`  nvim-cmp will present these two strings:
    `9`
    `1 2 3 ** + == 9`

2. As a standalone processor, using the `:RPN` command. Its different
variations are as follows:

    `:RPN` - replace the current line's RPN expression with its result.

    `:<range>RPN` - replace the selected lines with the result of processing
                  the concatenated RPN expression. The selection will always
                  be treated as a linewise selection.

    `:RPN <expression>` - treat all arguments as an RPN expression and insert
                        the result in a new line above the current line.

    Adding the bang operator, ie. `:RPN!`, to any of the syntaxes above will
    cause the expression to be inserted along with the result, like so:
        `30 rad sin == 0.5`

==============================================================================
*Operands*                                                          *rpn-operands*

Numbers, formally called operands, are pushed onto a stack in the order they
are read by the processor. The top number on the stack is called X, with Y, Z,
T, and other unnamed positions underneath. When an operator is encountered,
the required operands are popped off the stack, and the result of the
operation is pushed back onto the stack.

Operands can take on any of these forms:
  Decimal - integer, floating point, scientific notation
  Binary - `0b` prefix, followed by digits `0` and `1`.
  Hexadecimal - `0x` prefix, followed by digits `0`-`9` and letters `a`-`f`.
  Complex - an ordered pair of numbers in any of the above formats. For
            example `1.2,-0x43` represents `1.2-67i`.

==============================================================================
*Operators*                                                        *rpn-operators*
